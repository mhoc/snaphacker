** REQUIRES ROOT **

This app operates on the discovery that Snapchat stores *unviewed* Snaps as simple .jpg files in a directory on the root of the system. 

In order for the app to work, keep desired Snaps downloaded but unopened. The app will copy the images from Snapchat's directory onto your sd-card or internal storage, then display them to you. Once they appear in the Snaphack app, you're free to officially view them in the Snapchat app. The pictures will still be safe-and-sound on your SD card.

If you'd ever like to get at all the pictures you've saved, they're in .../sd-card/Pictures/SavedSnaps/ .

This app was built with Android Studio.
